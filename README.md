I've created a fully functional web-based Color Cash Game that you can use right away! This interactive game features:
Game Features:

Sleek dark-themed interface with vibrant color buttons
Real-time balance updates and bet controls
Complete statistics tracking (games played, wins, losses, win rate, net profit)
Game rules explanation with color indicators
Reset button to start over

How to Play:

Enter your bet amount in the input field
Choose one of three colors:

Green (Safe): 60% chance to win 1.5x your bet
Red (Risky): 30% chance to win 3x your bet
Gold (Jackpot): 10% chance to win 10x your bet


See your results immediately and watch your stats update

The game includes visual feedback (green background for wins, red for losses) and prevents invalid bets (amounts greater than your balance or negative values).
Would you like me to modify any aspect of the game? I could adjust the odds, add sound effects, create additional betting options, or make other improvements to enhance the gameplay experience.
