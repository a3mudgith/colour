Auto-Prediction Fortune Game
I've created an interactive fortune-telling game that automatically generates a new prediction every 10 seconds. Here's what makes this game special:
Key Features:

Automatic Predictions: Generates a new fortune every 10 seconds automatically
Interactive Timer: Visual countdown shows time until next prediction
Crystal Ball Animation: Glowing effect when new predictions are generated
Manual Controls: Options to pause/resume the automatic predictions or generate a new one immediately
40+ Unique Predictions: Wide variety of positive fortunes to keep the experience fresh

How It Works:

The game starts with a 10-second countdown timer
When the timer reaches zero, a new prediction is automatically generated
The crystal ball glows briefly to indicate a new prediction
Users can click the crystal ball or "New Prediction" button to get a prediction immediately
The "Pause" button stops the automatic countdown until resumed

How to Use:

Save the HTML file to your computer
Open it in any web browser
Watch as new predictions appear every 10 seconds
Click the crystal ball or buttons to interact with the game

This game is designed to be lightweight and work across all modern browsers. The visual design includes a mystical crystal ball and smooth animations to create an engaging experience.
Would you like me to modify any aspect of the game, such as changing the prediction interval, adding more fortunes, or adjusting the visual style?
